    <h1>Cyber Attacks</h1>
        <p> Virtual learning enables acquisition of knowledge and information through technologies such as computers, smartphones, tablets and wide area networks also known as E-learning. The existence of e- learning does contribute to the education field such as in the university because it improves the education quality and distributing and sharing of teaching material efficiently. Through the use of this distance learning, multiple institutions of education have improved their learning and teaching process. However, Since the systems and its tools depend on the network, it is vulnerable and prone to cyber security based attacks. Attacks are made to exploit the information stored from within the system. E-learnings systems are at risk of attacks such as identity theft, impersonation, and inadequate authentication to obtain data from the e-learning system.  </p>
