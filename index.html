	<h1> What Is The Problem?</h1>
        <p> With the growth of distance learning, particularly with the Covid-19 crisis, more and more education is conducted in a virtual classroom. Unfortunately, with the disappearance of face-to-face education, academic dishonesty has increased dramatically. Some of the issues are: Plagiarism, Identity Fraud, and Self-Plagiarism. This research will develop a comprehensive toolset that can be integrated into the online classroom to detect academic dishonesty. The toolset should be capable of clearly documenting the factors leading to the assessment of academic dishonesty in a manner supporting academic sanction. </p>
