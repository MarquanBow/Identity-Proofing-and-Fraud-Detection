    <h1> Plagiarism Checkers </h1>
        <p>When it comes to plagiarism there are numerous plagiarism checkers for students, teachers, professionals etc. to use. With so many checkers out there some are better than others but none are perfect. Each one has its own pros and cons. Scribbr, Ephorus, Quetext, Compilatio, and Bibme are some of the highest rated plagiarism checkers according to Scribbr (https://www.scribbr.com/plagiarism/best-plagiarism-checker/). Scribbr (in partnership with turnitin is the checker that has the largest database and it's secure. When it finds plagiarism it lists the sources that it found the plagiarism and the percentage of plagiarism, it's used at many universities and it’s the most accurate checker but the downside is that it's a paid service. Ephorus is a dying out service since it’s been bought by turnitin. A few universities still use it, still it’s similar to scribbr but it’s downside is that it’s not available to students. Quetext has a small database to cross check, it doesn’t check for scholarly articles, it reports many false positives and has a monthly subscription. Compilation does not cross check scholarly articles, doesn’t tell you what part is plagiarism, doesn’t report false positives, and it provides a very generic report. BibMe also has a small database, doesn’t report percentages, has a limited number of checks, the only upside is it has a built in citing tool.</p>
