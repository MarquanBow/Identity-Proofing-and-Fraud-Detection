    <h1> Introduction</h1>
        <p>Due to the ever-growing development of Information and Communication technology; the world has been going through its significant effects all simply by just connecting with people much easier over the internet including the education industry. Recently, distance education using virtual Learning has become popular in actual educational situations. Online learning enables acquisition of knowledge and information through technologies such as computers, smartphones, tablets and wide area networks. The existence of e- learning does contribute in the field of education such as in the university because it improves the education quality and distribution and sharing of teaching material efficiently.Through the use of e-learning, many educational institutions have improved their learning and teaching process. E-learning systems have become a very popular learning method for schools, universities and as well as businesses. There is many open source software as well as commercial e-learning software available in the market in this era. The examples of e-learning software are WebCT and Moodle; one of the most used e-learning systems. However, online learning as of recently has been compromised in terms of identity fraud and academic integrity in numerous ways from a student using another student to impersonate them during class or an exam to students and others utilizing cyber techniques to gain classified information for cheating and plagiarism. According to statistics, 61% of academic dishonesty cases occurred in the spring of 2020; furthermore, 60% of the spring term cases happened after the shift to virtual learning platforms. The purpose of this study is to conduct extensive research on learning management systems(LMS) and their countermeasures via establishing a literature survey on the various ways the technology currently used is being exploited. We also analyzed all of our findings and will be creating a GAP analysis.
